This includes, without limitation, any implied conditions of (but not limited to) property. Further, we do not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of materials on our website; or that of any sites liked to this site. In no event shall we, or our suppliers, be liable for any damages arising out of the use or inability to use our services. Because of some jurisdictions which do not allow limitations of liability for incidential damages, these limitations may not apply.</p>
		<p>This site’s included materials may include technical or graphical errors and we do not warrant that any of said materials are accurate, complete, or current. We may make changes to materials on our website, however we are not obligated to update them. All sites linked to our website have not been reviewed by us and we are not responsible for their contents.

		<p>These terms may be revised at any time without notice. By using this website, you agree to be bound by the current version of these terms. That being said, notable changes to our terms will be followed by an attempt to notify our community of these modifications.

		<h4>About the GPL and GFDL licenses</h4>
		<p>This server's open-source plugins are licensed under the GNU General Public License Version 2 or later. Our documentation and other publications are licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License 1.3 or later.</p>
		<p>The GPL is designed for programs; it contains lots of complex clauses that are crucical for programs and would be cumbersome and unnecessary for a book or manual. The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software—to make sure the software is free for all its users.</p>
		<p>The purpose of the GFDL (GNU Free Documentation License) is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.</p>

			<h1>Privacy policy</h1>
		</div>
		<p>The service advertised by this site is divided into a number of platforms that may each collect their own information. Aedificium bears with it privacy as a focus and intends to lay out how the information we collect is handled. We do not directly hand our players' personal information to third parties, embed trackers on this site or otherwise intend to exploit our users.</p>
		<p>When registering on the forum that is linked to and provided as an extension of this site, you will be asked to enter your: e-mail address, universally unique identifier and to set a password that is then made secure by the forum.  The forum software uses login cookies in order to keep track of your session but does not require any personal information and is an open-source project that you can audit.</p>
		<p>Third parties such as Discord and Mojang that you may submit to by joining our Discord server or creating a Minecraft account are not the subject of this privacy policy because they have their own policies.  Those clients are services of their own through which you may connect to and use our platforms.  The creative Minecraft server is not subject to Mojang's End User License Agreement because it does not operate the Java Edition server software, instead running the Cuberite server software which is not a fork thereof.</p>
		<p>We do not collect personal information from children under the age of 13 and do not permit underage children to use our service if aware of their age.  If you are a parent and you are aware that your child under the age of 13 has joined our forum or otherwise provided us with personal information then we will remove that information from our database.</p>
