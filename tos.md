		<p class="lead">Aedificium's plugins are licensed under the GNU General Public License Version 2 or later. Our documentation and other publications are licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License 1.3 or later.</p>
		<p>The GPL is designed for programs; it contains lots of complex clauses that are crucical for programs and would be cumbersome and unnecessary for a book or manual. The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software—to make sure the software is free for all its users.</p>
		<p>The purpose of the GFDL (GNU Free Documentation License) is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.</p>
		<p>The materials on this site are provided on an ‘as-is’ basis; we make no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaim and negate any other warranties. This includes, without limitation, any implied conditions of (but not limited to) property. Further, we do not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of materials on our website; or that of any sites liked to this site. In no event shall we, or our suppliers, be liable for any damages arising out of the use or inability to use our services. Because of some jurisdictions which do not allow limitations of liability for incidential damages, these limitations may not apply.</p>
		<p>This site’s included materials may include technical or graphical errors, and we do not warrant that any of said materials are accurate, complete, or current. We may make changes to materials on our website, however we are not obligated to update them. All sites linked to our website have not been reviewed by us, and we are not responsible for their contents. The inclusion of a link does not imply our endorsement, and its use is at the risk of the end user.</p>
		<p>These terms may be revised at any time without notice. By using this website, you agree to be bound by the then-current version of these terms. That being said, notable changes to our terms will be followed by an attempt to notify our community of these modifications. Governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States are these terms, and you irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of federal and state courts of the United States.</p>
