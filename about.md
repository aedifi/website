			<h1>About the server</h1>
		</div>
		<p>Aedificium is a semi-whitelisted architecture-oriented server for the sandbox video game Minecraft.  Anyone can join our server and explore what architects have built for themselves or apply for the position in order to get building.  There are three ranks on our server, discounting new players: architect, moderator, and administrator.  The rank of architect grants every permission that is not moderation-related on our server.</p>

            <dt>July 21, 2013</dt>
            <dd>The server began operating as a sandbox community named Chromium where every player was given building permissions.</dd>
			<dd>We originally ran a fork of CraftBukkit and a modified release of TotalFreedomMod, created by Steven Lawson and Jerom van der Sar, to give players "operator" access.</dd>
			<dt>August 31, 2015</dt>
			<dd>Chromium's server was destroyed due to a data loss incident.</dd>
			<dd>I created a new server based off the same model with the name "shadow.ga."</dd>
			<dt>May 4, 2018</dt>
			<dd>The server went offline for ~1 year and it has since returned as a place for builders with a whitelist as Aedificium.</dd>
			<dt>May 1, 2020</dt>
			<dd>We switched from a fork of the CraftBukkit server software to Cuberite, a free and open source (FOSS) server software.</dd>
			<dd>Shortly after this happened the development of our own plugins began in order to provide features that were previously had.</dd>

			<h1>Conduct policy</h1>
		</div>
		<p>The “conduct policy” represents a set of basic guidelines which are unified across every platform where our services are offered.  If our staff believe that you have violated these guidelines then they are permitted to take whatever action they deem necessary, which may extend to your account being banned.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>You will not use our services to do anything that violates local or federal United States law.</li>
			<li>You will cease to use the server and not continue to operate your forum account if you are under the age of 13.</li>
			<li>You will not threaten players with their personal information, post the personal information of players on this site, or request their information either in public or in private ("dox").</li>
			<li>The privacy of other players is important to this community. Avoid harassing other members by building in direct proximity to another player's project.</li>
			<li>Destroying the builds of others or modifying the work of others without their explicit permission is known as griefing, which will not be tolerated. Data backups of server files are routinely kept.</li>
			<li>Evading your punishment will result in a longer one. Instead, appeal it.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>We consider these guidelines to be succinct and understandable enough for players of all shortcomings to be devoid of an excuse not to have read them.</p>
