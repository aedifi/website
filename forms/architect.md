**Architect** is the one and only non-staff rank that exists on the server, notwithstanding regular players who are referred to as *visitors*.  This rank was created to grant extended building privileges to trusted members of the community who are interested in building things in creative mode.

In addition to the freebuild privileges granted to every player, architects may build in the architect-only regions of the main world ("world") and removes some contraints placed upon regular players in order to prevent excessive resource usage, such as the block size limit for WorldEdit selections.

In order to become an architect, the player must be sponsored by an established member of the community with the rank of architect, or a moderator or administrator.  This is normally accomplished by making a new conversation on the forum, in which the sponsor states their intentions, to which any player may air their objections before the server owner grants the rank of architect to the player being sponsored.

Sponsors will be held responsible for ensuring that the architects who they sponsor continue to act in good faith and remain in compliance with the conduct policy.  An architect who has been sponsored may themselves sponsor another architect once they have become an established member of the community.

Interested in joining the community?  That's great!  This page explains how to apply for the "architect" rank, which is just one step above the default rank assigned to visitors on the server.  As the name implies, architects are people who construct things and have complete access to the plugins on our server excluding commands related to moderation.

There's a short application that can be filled out on this page which asks for your username along with some other impersonal questions that may filter out players who would not qualify.  The outcome of your application will be determuned by the quality of what you've already built in Minecraft, so you will need to supply a few image screenshots from the game.

After a player applies for the architect rank they'll be notified of its outcome via e-mail.  If an application doesn't get accepted, another one can be submitted after 30 days.
