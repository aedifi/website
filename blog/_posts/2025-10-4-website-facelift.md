Hello again, Aedificiumites.  This will be my first blog post ever since what feels like the recent return of the server, which was in fact almost one month ago.  I have remained steadfast in remaining interested in making progress on the server, in more ways than one.  As such, I have spent the weekend giving a little bit of a facelift to most parts of the website, namely; the index (home) page; the (newly emancipated) [map](/map) page, and; various other things, such as the navigation and footer sections of the page.

You may expect more changes to come in the near future as I seek to further integrate the in-game server experience with that of using the website, which includes the forum.  Thankfully, the forum is powered using a forum software project which I happen to be familiar enough with in order to make it unique to any functions which might better serve the Aedificium platform.
