The service advertised by this site is divided into a number of platforms that may each collect their own information. Aedificium bears with it privacy as a focus and intends to lay out how the information we collect is handled. We do not directly hand our players' personal information to third parties, embed trackers on this site or otherwise intend to exploit our users.

When registering on the forum that is linked to and provided as an extension of this site, you will be asked to enter your: e-mail address, universally unique identifier and to set a password that is then made secure by the forum.  The forum software uses login cookies in order to keep track of your session but does not require any personal information and is an open-source project that you can audit.

Third parties such as Discord and Mojang that you may submit to by joining our Discord server or creating a Minecraft account are not the subject of this privacy policy because they have their own policies.  Those clients are services of their own through which you may connect to and use our platforms.  The creative Minecraft server is not subject to Mojang's End User License Agreement because it does not operate the Java Edition server software, instead running the Cuberite server software which is not a fork thereof.

We do not collect personal information from children under the age of 13 and do not permit underage children to use our service if aware of their age.  If you are a parent and you are aware that your child under the age of 13 has joined our forum or otherwise provided us with personal information then we will remove that information from our database.
