	<h4>Defining the creative server</h4>
	<p>The Minecraft server offers several methods of interaction through various clients.  As mentioned in the about page it runs Cuberite, a free and open source (FOSS) server software.  Because of Cuberite's limitations the software only supports features from the <code>1.12.2 (340)</code> version/protocol at this time.  It runs behind a proxy and lets players connect with versions leading up to the latest known release <code>1.18.1 (757)</code>.</p>
	<p>Joining the creative server through a forced host can be accomplished with the address <code>creative.aedi.app</code>.  The <code>aedi.app</code> address will direct clients to the server they were last on and defaults to creative.</p>
