		<h1>Survival server</h1>
	</div>
	<p>We have a survival server hosted on <code>survival.aedi.app</code> that acts as an extension of the creative server, a side project, which anyone can join.  It's based off a high-scale map of the Earth with nation's borders intact and has the Towny plugin for players to claim chunks of land.</p>
	<h4>Towny basics</h4>
	<p>The operative goal of our survial extension is to establish competitiveness while remaining fun. It costs nothing to start a town using <code>/t new &lt;name&gt;</code> however chunks of land start at $10 in-game currency and that cost will increase +2.5% per each additionally claimed piece of land.</p>
	<p>Towns have a daily upkeep which requires a balance to be deposited into them using <code>/t deposit &lt;amount&gt;</code> from your Essentials balance.  The total upkeep amount is determined by the amount of chunks claimed by a town.  Nations have a daily upkeep that starts at $100 and increases as more towns are invited.</p>
	<p>It costs $100 to start a nation using <code>/n new &lt;nation&gt; [capital]</code> under which multiple towns can join. A player can only be the mayor of one town and the king of one nation at once. Having a town and a nation are not mutually exclusive.</p>
	<h4>Declaring war</h4>
	<p>This Towny setup uses the FlagWar system to capture parts of other players' towns using blocks known as flags. The war flag is an <b>oak fence</b> which can be placed in an enemy's plot where the proper conditions are met. Those conditions are as follows:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>You must place your flag where there is no ceiling anywhere above. (It must be open sky.)</li>
		<li>You and the other town must each have a nation and those nations must consider each other enemies.</li>
		<li>You and the other town must not be neutral/peaceful.</li>
		<li>You and the defenders must have at least two people online in the town and nation.</li>
		<li>You might have to attack the plots on the edge of the town before you attack inwards.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>More information about how to play through FlagWar can be found at <a href="https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/FlagWar/wiki/Attacking-and-Defending" target="_blank">this page</a>. Both parties should understand the strategy of this plugin before attacking/defending with it. The cost of a war flag is set at $5,000 to stake, or to place on an enemy's plot.</p>
	<h4>Voting for the server</h4>
	<p>Casting a vote in favor of the server on a number of gameserver listing websites will give you benefits.  Each player is given $1,000 in-game currency by the server in exchange for their vote.  Below are a number of websites you may vote on that will be recognized.</p>

	<h4>Dynamic map</h4>
	<p>There is a dynamic map generated with Dynmap and hosted on <code>survival.aedi.app</code> <a href="https://survival.aedi.app/" target="_blank">in your browser</a>.  This is exclusive to the survival extension and may load slower than the static map generated with Mapcrafter or may not be served at all if the server is offline.</p>
	<h3>CB1092 beta server</h3>
	<p>A very basic survival server for <b>beta 1.7.3</b> of Java Edition is hosted on <code>beta.aedi.app</code> with required port <code>55565</code> if you'd like to enjoy the simpler days of Minecraft.  Several known bugs with the CraftBukkit server software, CB1060, have been patched as part of <a href="https://github.com/RhysB/Project-Poseidon" target="_blank">Project Poseidon</a>.</p>
