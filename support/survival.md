		<h1>Survival server</h1>
	</div>
	<p>We have a survival server hosted on <code>survival.aedi.app</code> that acts as an extension of the creative server, a side project, which anyone can join.  It's based off a high-scale map of the Earth with nation's borders intact and has the Towny plugin for players to claim chunks of land.</p>
	<h4>Towny basics</h4>
	<p>The operative goal of our survial extension is to establish competitiveness while remaining fun. It costs nothing to start a town using <code>/t new &lt;name&gt;</code> however chunks of land start at $10 in-game currency and that cost will increase +2.5% per each additionally claimed piece of land.</p>
	<p>Towns have a $10 daily upkeep which requires a balance to be deposited into them using <code>/t deposit &lt;amount&gt;</code> from your Essentials balance. Nations have a $1 daily upkeep.</p>
	<p>It costs $100 to start a nation using <code>/n new &lt;nation&gt; [capital]</code> under which multiple towns can join. A player can only be the mayor of one town and the king of one nation at once. Having a town and a nation are not mutually exclusive.</p>
	<h4>Voting for the server</h4>
	<p>Casting a vote in favor of the server on a number of gameserver listing websites will give you benefits.  Each player is given $1,000 in-game currency by the server in exchange for their vote.  Below are a number of websites you may vote on that will be recognized.</p>

	<h4>Dynamic map</h4>
	<p>There is a dynamic map generated with Dynmap and served with the <a href="https://survival.aedi.app/" target="_blank">internal web server</a> that can be visited from the survival server's address in your browser.  This is exclusive to the survival extension and may load slower than the static map generated with Mapcrafter that is described earlier in this documentation or may not be served at all if the server is offline.</p>
