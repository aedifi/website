**Architect** is the one and only non-staff rank that exists on the server, notwithstanding regular players who are referred to as *visitors*.  This rank was created to grant extended building privileges to trusted members of the community who are interested in building things in creative mode.

In addition to the freebuild privileges granted to every player, architects may build in the architect-only regions of the main world ("world") and removes some contraints placed upon regular players in order to prevent excessive resource usage, such as the block size limit for WorldEdit selections.

In order to become an architect, the player must be sponsored by an established member of the community with the rank of architect, or a moderator or administrator.  This is normally accomplished by making a new conversation on the forum, in which the sponsor states their intentions, to which any player may air their objections before the server owner grants the rank of architect to the player being sponsored.

Sponsors will be held responsible for ensuring that the architects who they sponsor remain in compliance with the conduct policy and continue to act in good faith as a member of the community.
