		<h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>
		<p>Before asking for help with anything, you should read through this list of <b>frequently asked questions</b> and ensure that what you're asking hasn't already been addressed.</p>
		<h4>Is [insert version here] supported?</h4>
		<p>Because of Cuberite's limitations the software only supports features from the <code>1.12.2 (340)</code> version/protocol at this time.  It runs behind a proxy and lets players connect with versions leading up to the latest known release <code>1.18.1 (757)</code>.</p>
		<h4>Is there a map of the server?</h4>
		<!-- Mapcrafter explanation -->
		<p>The <a href="https://mapcrafter.org/" target="_blank">Mapcrafter</a> map renderer is used to display an isometric view of our worlds that is served with nginx.  Our maps are hosted on <code>map.aedi.app</code> <a href="https://map.aedi.app/" target="_blank">in your browser</a> and a cropped position of the creative spawnpoint is displayed in an iframe on this site's homepage.</p>
		<!-- Dynmap explanation -->
		<p>There is also a dynamic map generated with Dynmap and hosted on <code>survival.aedi.app</code> <a href="https://survival.aedi.app/" target="_blank">in your browser</a>.  This is exclusive to the survival extension and may load slower than the static map generated with Mapcrafter or may not be served at all if the server is offline.</p>
