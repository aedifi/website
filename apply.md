		<p>Interested in joining the community?  That's great!  This page explains how to apply for the "architect" rank, which is just one step above the default rank assigned to visitors on the server.  As the name implies, architects are people who construct things and have complete access to the plugins on our server excluding commands related to moderation.</p>
		<p>There's a short application that can be filled out on this page which asks for your username along with some other impersonal questions that may filter out players who would not qualify.  The outcome of your application will be determuned by the quality of what you've already built in Minecraft, so you will need to supply a few image screenshots from the game.</p>
		<p>After a player applies for the architect rank they'll be notified of its outcome via e-mail.  If an application doesn't get accepted, another one can be submitted after 30 days.</p>
